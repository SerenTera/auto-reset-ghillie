# auto-reset-ghillie
Automatically reset ghillie after you done it and teleported out of ghillieglade (to the entrance or elsewhere). 

Requires commands module by Pinkie-Pie. Otherwise, remove lines 4,8 and 14 from index.js if you are not using commands module.

The dungeon reset takes place only after you completed ghillie (when reward chest appears) and after teleporting out of ghilleglade to any location.
